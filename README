I2C implementation using FTDI FT4232H
Written by: Ori Idan Helicon technologies (ori@helicontech.co.il)

This software is a free software distributed under GPL version 3.0 or later.
Refer to COPYING for the full text of the license.

This code contains two command line utilities: i2csend and i2cget.
The code is implemented using libftdi (free library for FTDI chips)

This version supports only one F4232 chip connected to any USB port of your system. It will search for the first chip and initialize it. It was not tested on a system with more then one F4232 chips.

Compiling:

Before compling the code insure that libftdi development files are installed in your system.
On a debian based system (debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc.) this is done by the command: sudo apt-get install libftdi-dev
I did not try it on other deistributions but there should not be any problem.

After extracting the files from the tarball, enter the directory where the files reside and execute make.
This will compile both i2csend and i2cget.


Using:
In order to send bytes, use the i2csend with the address and bytes to send.
For example: to send 0x07 0xaa 0x55 to address 0x20 use the command: i2csend 0x20 0x07 0xaa 0x55

In order to read bytes, use the i2cget with the address and number of bytes to read.
For example: to read 2 bytes from address 0x20 use the command: i2cget 0x20 2

Note that both commands must be run as root.
